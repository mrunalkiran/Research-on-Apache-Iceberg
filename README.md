# Apache Iceberg ‚Äì Spark + Scala Demo Project

This project demonstrates how to use *Apache Iceberg* with *Spark and Scala* for large-scale data lake processing, versioned data management, and visual analytics.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Implemented using *Spark 3.5, **Iceberg 1.4.2, and **Scala 2.12*
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Created a synthetic dataset of 5,000+ event records
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Performed:
  - Table creation and schema evolution
  - Time travel (snapshot-based querying)
  - Manifest & data file inspection
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Exported results for visualizations using Python (Matplotlib)

## Insights

	‚Ä¢	Iceberg enables ACID compliance, time travel, and schema flexibility
	‚Ä¢	Spark integration makes batch processing simple and fast
	‚Ä¢	Python is more efficient than Vegas (Scala) for custom visualizations
